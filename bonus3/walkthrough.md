in this level, if we try to run the program with gdb or ltrace it will just exit and that happens because of the return of fopen that doesn't go through because it's not executed with suid bit set.
We can see that program exits if we didn't enter two arguments, then proceeds to read the contents of the file into a buffer and then uses the return of atoi(argv[1]) to put '\0' at that index. then compares argv[1] to that buf. that means this test will fail no matter what unless our arg is an empty string because it will be counted as 0 by atoi and the buffer will terminate the string at index 0 as well.
